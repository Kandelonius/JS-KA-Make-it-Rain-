# JS-KA-Make-it-Rain-
Uses arrays to make shapes fall repeatedly from the top of the screen

Make it Rain uses arrays to make objects fall from the top of the screen 
to the bottom and then reappear at the top. The shapes that fall are random colors. 
The user can click on the screen to create new objects.

Meant to follow:
Add more drops to the arrays.
Make it so that the drops start back at the top once they've reached the bottom, using a conditional.
Make an array of colors, so that every drop is a different color.
Make other things rain, like snowflakes (using more shape commands) or avatars (using the image commands).
Make it so that when the user clicks, a new drop is added to the array.
Initialize the arrays using a for loop and random() function, at the beginning of the program.
